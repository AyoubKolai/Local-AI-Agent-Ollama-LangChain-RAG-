# Local-AI-Agent-Ollama-LangChain-RAG

This project is a **local AI-powered agent** built using **Ollama**, **LangChain**, and **ChromaDB** for vector search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  

The agent is designed to **analyze and understand product reviews**, allowing users to ask natural language questions about the reviews. It retrieves the most relevant review data from the Chroma vector database, processes it through the Ollama LLM, and returns accurate, context-aware answers.  

### 🔧 Key Features
- **Local LLM inference** powered by Ollama (no external API required)
- **ChromaDB integration** for efficient vector search and storage
- **Question-answering** system based on user queries and review data

### 🗂️ Tech Stack
- **Ollama** — Local large language model
- **LangChain** — Orchestration of the retrieval and generation pipeline
- **ChromaDB** — Vector database for semantic search
